<h3> Our love story began in 1999.  We were in high school, but our love was tested from 2012-2013. For me love looks like: 5 deployments, 4 PCS’s, a two week mental health hospitalization with him by my side, 19 days of him being in a coma, his 3 month hospitalization, and many sleepless nights. I took the vows “’til death do us part,” but I never knew the extent of our love until death almost did us part.  </h3> <img src="miliboypic1.jpg" widt1h="400" height="400;">
