<h1>The Real Story of the Easter Bunny: Origin, Myths, and Fun Facts."</h1>
<br>
<h3>We're diving down the rabbit hole to separate fact from fiction and bust a few hare-raising myths.</h3> <br>

<p style="text-align: right;">BY TERRI ROBERTSONUPDATED: APR 3, 2023</p>

<h3 style="color: #48d1cc">the Easter Bunny is a bit like Santa Claus: a benevolent bearer of gifts for good children and a star of holiday mall pictures—with an origin story that can be fuzzier than a bunny’s tail.

Perhaps your child is beginning to ask questions and you want to give them an informed answer. Or, maybe you are wondering if there is a dark history behind the Easter Bunny. After all, adorable bunny cakes and Easter baskets are a lot of fun, but they don’t have a lot to do with why Christians celebrate Easter Sunday. Whatever reason brought you here, you’ve come to the right place, because we’re answering the most-asked questions about the Easter Bunny’s origins..<br> <img src="ladyart.jpg" width="400" height="400;"> From the mythical creature’s European roots to its arrival in Colonial America—not to mention some hare-raising tales of pagan beginnings—we’ve gone down the rabbit hole to separate fact from fiction and bust a few myths. (By the way, the Easter bunny began as a hare, not a rabbit, but when it comes to ole E.B., it’s best not to get too bogged down in technicalities.) Read on for the true story of the Easter Bunny.<h2> Where Did the Easter Bunny Originate? </h2>

The bunny, originally called "Oschter Haws," or Easter Hare, who lays a nest of colorful eggs for well-behaved children, hails from Germany. The earliest known mention, according to A Dictionary of English Folklore, is a German text from 1572, which translated reads:

Skip forward to 1682, and we find the German physician and botanist Georg Franck von Franckenau recounting the children’s story of Oschter Haws, who laid eggs in the garden, which young ones would hunt for—just like our Easter egg hunts today.

In Germany, as in America and elsewhere, traditions surrounding the Easter Bunny grew more elaborate with time, featuring chocolate bunnies and chocolate eggs, as well as toys. (For a fun recollection of Easter Bunny traditions in Germany in the 1950s, check out this account from the Chicago Tribune.
<h2> When Did the Easter Bunny Come to America?</h2>

E.B.’s legend hopped continents, landing in Pennsylvania Dutch communities in Colonial America no later than 1757 (and possibly earlier), according Stephen Winick, PhD, of the Library of Congress’s American Folklife Center, in his article “On the Bunny Trail: In Search of the Easter Bunny.”

The scholar bases that date on the year a young artist named Johann Conrad Gilbert immigrated to Pennsylvania from Germany. Later in his life, Gilbert would produce two famous drawings of the Easter Bunny—our earliest hard evidence of an American E.B. Since the artist must have known the German tradition from his youth, writes Winick, he would have carried it with him across the Atlantic (though it's possible the E.B. preceded him).</h3>
