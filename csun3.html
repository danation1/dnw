<p>Cleansing should be an important task in your routine if you it is your desire to look your best since your skin can be dulled by dead skin cells, buildup of makeup, and sweat. Never give excuses that you are tired or you don't have the time. You should never skip your cleansing rituals. If you have a dry skin, you can benefit from thick, creamy cleansers. On the other hand, if your skin is oily, you can gain most from cleansing balms, washes, or bars.
