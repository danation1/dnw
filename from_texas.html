<h1 >What is a handshake worth?</h1>

<h5> In one of the most fascinating legal cases in Texas history, one oil titan sued another, and the case turned on whether or not, in Texas, a promise – a formal agreement – and handshakes equaled a legal contract.</h5>

<p>How much is a promise worth? How much is it worth if you guarantee the promise with a handshake? What is the value of one’s word? In Texas, once, all these taken together were worth over $10 billion in a court of law.  

In one of the most fascinating legal cases in Texas history, one oil titan sued another, and the case turned on whether or not, in Texas, a promise – a formal agreement – and handshakes equaled a legal contract. Here is the short version of what happened.  

In 1983, Pennzoil wanted to buy controlling interest in Getty Oil and the leaders of the two companies, along with their lawyers and investment bankers and such, met in a New York hotel and hammered out a deal over 25 hours. In the end, Getty agreed that Pennzoil would purchase controlling interest in their company for $110 a share. A memorandum of understanding was signed in which Getty certified the deal, with some tweaks on that price to be allowed later. More formal, detailed legal documents would be signed soon. Handshakes followed which sealed the promise being made. A press release was sent to the papers. The announcement of the deal was printed in the Wall Street Journal the following day. 

In a plot line worthy of the TV show “Succession,” Texaco was informed of the Pennzoil deal and swept in as the white knight to offer Getty a more respectable $125 dollars a share, which the Getty board quickly accepted. Texaco and Getty Oil were merged. Texaco’s perspective was, “That’s the rough and tumble world of big oil. You snooze, you lose, Pennzoil. You should have gotten a formal, detailed, 200-page contract printed and signed.”

Pennzoil sued Texaco for contractual interference and financial damages totalling $10.5 billion, the largest suit of its kind ever. It was the corporate version of alienation of affection. Texaco unjustly and dishonorably robbed Pennzoil of the lucrative deal they had made. But to win, Pennzoil had to prove that they had a contract with Getty in the first place. Was a promise in the form of “the word” of corporate leaders and handshakes equal to a contract?  

Joe Jamail was the man who would have to prove it. No less than the great Texas lawyer Percy Foreman had once declared Jamail as the finest trial lawyer the U.S. had ever produced. High praise, indeed. Jamail was not a contract law specialist. He was a personal injury lawyer, but his special genius was making the complex, simple and boiling down many-layered cases to a central theme of “right and wrong.” For this case, he focused on the value of a promise. 

The first thing he did was to make sure the case was tried in Texas rather than New York. He didn’t want the case decided by New York lawyers arguing about the nuances of contract law. He wanted a morality play. Jamail wanted a jury of Texans who were more likely to decide the case on what was right rather than what was legal. He sat a jury that was composed mostly of women who had enjoyed long marriages, who had worked in the same companies for years and worshiped at the same churches most of their lives. He wanted jurors who honored vows and promises and believed that your word was your bond and that handshakes were contracts. 

It became a case in which the cultures of New York and Texas were on trial, too. One of the New York team, some months before, unfortunately had a back room comment slip into the record. He declared his shock that people in Texas thought a handshake was a contract. This was red meat for Jamail. He got one of the New York team to admit on the stand that a promise was fine for a $10 agreement, but not so sacred when billions were on the table. The New York lawyers even complained to the judge that the Texas legal team, in just the way they said “New York,” were making it sound pejorative.  

To undermine Texaco’s strategy of focusing on the complex realities of contract law, Jamail told the jury, “When the law is on the lawyers side, he talks about the law. When the facts are on the lawyer’s side, he talks about the facts…” So Jamail talked about facts. At the end of his summation he said that the evidence in the case shows, “A grievous wrong has been done to Pennzoil by reason of their undoing of this binding agreement… I know you are going to do the right thing. You are people of morality and conscience and strength. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by.”

Pennzoil won. Texaco appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, but they let the judgment stand. Jamail got $345 million for his litigation services and, in time, became the first billionaire practicing attorney in U.S. history. He happily shared his wealth generously with his alma mater, the University of Texas. He said there was no fun in just having money. “The fun was in seeing someone else have an opportunity” because of it.

<h1 >How Moms Use The Legend Of La Llorona To Keep Their Kids In Line</h1>
<h5> “The crying woman” mourns the loss of her love and her children, and haunts kids who stray too far from home.</h5>

<p> La Llorona – the crying woman – is a Mexican legend that is at least 500 years old. It no doubt arrived in Texas with the earliest Mexican settlers. And La Llorona has haunted our rivers, lakes and streams ever since, particularly in the border regions. There are dozens of versions. Here is one.

La Llorona was a poor girl in a small village. She was extraordinarily beautiful with raven black hair and large almond eyes. One day when she was getting water from the town well, a handsome man on a fine horse rode up and asked her for a drink. She had never seen such a perfect man or felt so wonderfully nervous in the presence of one before. He felt the same way about her. They fell in love on the spot. He could not marry her, though, because she was a poor village girl and he was from a the richest, most prominent family in the region. But he could not live without her so he bought her a big home and showered her with jewelry and gifts and gave her two children. He came to visit often and adored playing with their children. It was not perfect, but she was happy because she loved him so much.

After a few years, a period of time came when he did not visit at all. She was worried about him and did something she had never done. She went to the big city to visit his mansion to see what was wrong. When she arrived she quietly asked a servant if he was there and she said, “Oh, no, today he is getting married to a famous princess from Spain.”

La Llorona was so angry that she wanted to do something to hurt him. In that jealous rage, she went straight home and took their two children to the river and drowned them. When she regained her sanity, she was plunged into such despair over what she had done that she died of grief right there on the river bank. As she attempted to enter the afterlife, an angel asked her where her children were. She said she didn’t know. She was told she must find them before she could rest. So she was forced back to Earth and condemned to wander rivers and lakes and streams looking for her children forever.

If you go out near water at night you will sometimes hear her crying, “Mis hijos, mis hijos.” My children. They say if she sounds near she is really far away, but if she sounds far away, she is very near you. Those who’ve seen her say that she wears a moldy shroud and has jet black hair, but no nose and no mouth, only luminous violet eyes that are horrifyingly red-streaked from her eternal crying. If you see her thrashing around the middle of a creek or river, don’t go in to try to save her because she will drown you.

You should also never let your children stay out late near a river or creek or lake – or even a backyard swimming pool, because La Llorona may think they are her children and steal them away from you forever.

So La Llorona is a legend, a cautionary tale and the boogie man – coo-cooey – all in one. Hispanic moms particularly have used her to enforce good behavior for centuries.

“Come inside now or La Llorona will get you.” “You come straight home from David’s house. Don’t wander. La Llorona is always looking for lost children.” And some even say that La Llorona makes children respect their mothers. She has appeared to children who have left their homes angrily, saying bad things to their mothers as they’ve left. La Llorona finds them walking in the dark and says, “I’ll let you go this time, but go back to your mother and be good to her.”

Excellent advice for Halloween and all the other days of the year.</p>

<h1 >It’s One Of Texas’ Oldest Businesses. You May Not Know The Name, But You’ve Almost Certainly Tasted The Food.</h1>

<h5>The flour mill Carl Hilmar Guenther built in San Antonio 1859 is still there in the same spot – much updated, of course. It’s now part of a giant international corporation..</h5>

<p> Carl Hilmar Guenther left Germany for America when he was 22. The year was 1846. He left without telling his parents he was going for fear they’d try to stop him. Young Guenther sailed for America because he thought his future was limited in Germany. He wrote that he “felt hemmed in,” that there was little freedom and nothing was happening. America, with it’s promise of infinite opportunities called to him. “If I cannot see the world in my youth,”he told his parents, “then life won’t mean much to me.”

Upon his arrival in New York, he worked briefly as a laborer and then went on to Wisconsin where he worked in farming and saw mills. The game changer came when he was able to buy a set of carpenter’s tools for $30. With those tools he was no longer a laborer. He owned a business.

Guenther then headed south to Mississippi, where he built houses and barns and cabinets, but he didn’t much care for the plantation society he found there. After about four years in the U.S., he thought he might go back to Germany, but first, he wanted to see the place he’d heard so much about: Texas.

In San Antonio, he learned about the German community of Fredericksburg and went there to discover they needed a mill to process the local grain into flour. He had learned the milling trade from his father back in Germany, so he set about building a mill on Live Oak Creek. After borrowing money from his father to buy 150 acres of land, Guenther hired local men on promissory notes guaranteeing future payment for their helping him build a dam, a water wheel and a mill. Guenther was so honest and reliable that his notes were used in the area as a trustworthy currency.

He married, had children and, because of the success of his mill, they quickly became one of the wealthiest families in Fredericksburg. After a flood destroyed his dam and damaged his mill, he rebuilt it and thought he should build another one in San Antonio because the city would soon have a population of 10,000 people. It was 1859 and the little city was already a bustling, promising market. Also, the San Antonio River was a more reliable water source.

With the help of Alsatian immigrants from nearby Castroville, Guenther built his new mill. He paid for their labor, in part, with flour futures – the guarantee of future product they’d need. Guenther wrote to his mother that San Antonio was about one third Mexican, one third German, and one third Anglo. His son, he noted, spoke Spanish, English, and German, sometimes all in the same sentence.

The mill Guenther built in 1859 is still there in the same spot, much updated, of course. It is now a giant international corporation: Pioneer Flour Mills, doing business as C. H. Gunther & Son, is one of the oldest continuously operating businesses in Texas. You can go there today and tour Pioneer Mills and the original Guenther House, now an exquisite museum and restaurant

In 1859, the only mechanical element was the water wheel turning the millstones.

Today, the plant is computerized and has robots working collaboratively with people to make flour and flour-based products, like fine gravies, for restaurants and bakeries. Pioneer makes pancake mix for Whataburger and the Whataburger pancake mix is sold at H-E-B, alongside their own Pioneer pancake mix and Pioneer flour. You may also be familiar with the White Wings (La Paloma) tortilla mix. That’s also made by Pioneer Flour. A subsidiary provides the McGriddle buns to McDonalds. If you’re from Texas, you’ve certainly tasted their products. Their reach is impressive. A European subsidiary even sells its breads in Germany where Guenther came from several generations ago. How cool is that? That’s the entrepreneurial cycle of life. From Saxony to San Antonio and back to Saxony.

<h1>Texas Republicans look to private lawsuits to hamstring local governments</h1>
<h5> GOP lawmakers in the Legislature want to dramatically limit what local governments can regulate – including wages, hours, evictions and the environment. </h5>

<p> From KERA:

Republicans who control the Texas Legislature want to dramatically limit what local governments can regulate – including wages, hours, evictions, and the environment.

House Bill 2127 might also drown cities in legal bills.

But how would the state make cities comply?

Rather than have state agencies spend countless hours of staff time to police all of Texas’ 254 county governments and more than 1,200 incorporated cities, it would empower private citizens to sue.

No immunity
The current text of HB 2127 allows “any person who has sustained an injury in fact, actual or threatened, from a municipal or county ordinance” to bring a lawsuit if the ordinance falls under certain areas of state law. Those include labor code, natural resources code, occupations code, and six other areas.

Trade associations, which represent business interests, would also have “standing,” i.e. legal permission to sue.

Governmental immunity, official immunity, and qualified immunity — traditional defenses that can protect governments from litigation or limit potential damages in a lawsuit — would not be permitted as a defense for lawsuits brought under this bill.

This provision, plus the fact that some areas of local government might fall under more than one chapter of the state code, has local officials worried about endless litigation.

Alarm systems, for example, are regulated by both the occupations code and the fire code. The occupations code is covered by the bill, while the fire code is not.

“We would have to take those on a case-by-case basis,” Dallas Assistant City Attorney Laura Morrison testified before a house committee in March. “I think there would be a lot of litigation stemming from that.”

And defending against lawsuits could siphon off money that would otherwise go to roads or public safety, said Brian Rowland, the former mayor of Prairie View.

“If it’s a corporation that’s suing about ordinances around density or zoning, they may be willing to spend a whole lot of money and the city never budgeted coming up with $100,000 [for] a lawsuit,” Rowland told KERA.

The bill’s author, Lubbock Republican Rep. Dustin Burrows, said eliminating governmental immunity was necessary for these cases to have a chance.

“Right now, if I bring a lawsuit against any sort of government agency, I will get tossed out on a defense of ‘sovereign immunity,’” Burrows said in testimony.

The bill also allows a person or trade association that sues a city or county to recover “reasonable” attorney’s fees from the city. There is no mention of awarding damages.

Burrows said he chose to not explicitly allow a court or jury to award damages, as that would be “a bridge too far.”

Setting a narrative
Allowing a private litigant to sue a city has a secondary benefit to Republicans like Burrows who control state government.

Such lawsuits frame the narrative in a way that puts cities on the defensive against one of their residents, said Jon Michaels, a law professor at UCLA.

“When the state comes in and shuts down a local problem, the local community gets defensive and gets annoyed at the state,” Michaels said. “The optics of a neighbor bringing a suit as opposed to a lawyer from Austin bringing that suit are very different.”

The bill passed the Texas House last month, was sent over to the State Senate, where it is currently pending in the business and commerce committee.

Progressive local officials like Rowland, who is currently running for a city council seat, fear the specter of individual lawsuits will chill the desire to solve local problems in new ways.

“I think it would stop having people be forward-thinking and really only [think] about covering its bases, playing it safe,” he said.
